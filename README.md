The project that I am observing is called Mapping America’s Future and can be located at: http://apps.urban.org/features/mapping-americas-futures/#map

I have included a screenshot of the digital geography project here:

Introduction:
This is an interactive map where you can change the rates for birth, death and migration to test how America’s population will change between 2020 to 2030. The map also lets you select filters for age, race and boundary with different options. The targeted audience is the general public as anyone with access to internet can find this webpage. However, this information is useful to many different people such as doctors, business owners, and many more that could use this information in a variety of ways. The authors of this map include 8 people whose names include Rolf PendallNan Marie Astone, Steven Martin, H. Elizabeth Peters, Austin Nichols, Kaitlin Franks Hildner, Allison Stolte, Pam Blumenthal Adrienne Hapanowicz and Tim Meko who are all a part of a research team at Urban Institute.  The Urban Institute is a school based in Washington D.C. and was founded in 1968. The Urban Institute received funding in several different ways including the government contracts, private donors and foundations.

Client and services:
A small introduction on what client and servers are is that they have a relationship where in a system there are tasks each one is supposed to carry out. The client in this interactive web map would be the researchers at Urban Institute that are requesting information from the server they created. The server would include all the data they collected and predicted with their research and expected outcomes that they built themselves. In this case, I think the server also includes the Urban Institute’s website which is being used to display all this information and makes it easily accessible. The web architecture is represented with HTML code.
The services of this map include displaying graphs and there are two different version, a line graph or a bar graph. After selecting different filter for the map, there’s information that tells you the percent growth in percentage and the different numbers that show the population change. Furthermore, it is nice that you can choose between any years between 2010 to 2030 when inputting features and filters for the map. Another nice feature the authors includes was being able to use your mouse and hover over a color in a legend to only see that shade of color on the map.

Data sources:
You can also download the data that was used to create this map if you want to which is a nice option the authors added for everyone. The data available for download include Variable Codebook, All data for all scenarios for the selected area (updated December 2017), Geographic crosswalk between counties and commuting zones, Map data for current assumption and boundary settings (updated December 2017) and all available data (0.5GB) (updated December 2017). It looks like all the data was compiled and created by the researchers at the Urban Institute. The overall user interface is pretty good, it’s simple and straightforward. You hover over different locations to view the percentage of population growth or decline and you can change filters to change what you see.

Inspect the code:
The libraries include google fonts (fonts.googleapis.com). The code isn’t organized line by line like it typically is when I have opened other codes so they could have done that so that it would be easier for me to look at and analyze. Looking at the code there is a lot of information from twitter on here which means they probably had to get a developer account to create this map. This snippet of the code shows how much twitter content they used.

 They also created a CSS file and linked it to the HTML using href. This is shown in the code by this “<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/app.min.css">” line of code. They have also written code to create many different classes to enable the interactive features of this map. There are also a lot of external links in the html. They also have a lot of code I don’t understand such as data-toggle, data migration and data placement. Although I’m sure that these are necessary to get the map to work correctly on the website. Using the inspection tool on Google I can see that they only used one javascript library which is called app.min.js which I’m not sure what it is used for. However, after doing a Google search I found that the min.js is a style sheet thing includes information for phones such as iOS and android. The code also includes several images such as <img class="logo-image hidden-xs hidden-sm hidden-md async" data-src="images/logo_revblue_trans.png"> I would say that this digital geography project supports responsive design and the user can control a lot of features by using the filters, inputting the year and even being able to choose what the map shows.

Base map and other features available:
The map for this project is just the USA states outlined, I’m not sure where they got the map from as it doesn’t say. There’s a legend to the map that uses colors to describe how much percentage a state’s population grows or declines. You can find the exact percentage when you hover over a state and a textbox with information will show up. You can also zoom in or out with the two buttons on the top right corner.

Strengths & weaknesses:
The strengths of this map is that it’s visually appealing and easy to use. Another strength is the hover feature which makes the map more interactive and interesting to look at. Also, the map includes cities in some states that are famous such as Seattle, Boston, New York, Chicago, Minneapolis and New Orleans. But, some weaknesses of the map include how there’s a lot of information that they could’ve used a dashboard to organize. This would make it even easier for people to see all the information in one place. Another weakness is that there’s no base map, the map just displays the U.S states so it would be better if they could include one. In addition, they could’ve included more cities of each state on the map instead of just choosing the prominent and famous cities. The map could include things like title, north arrow, and more to make it seem more official. Although the article is titled, there is no title on the map itself.

Social theory, digital divide and others:
This map is useful for people who study anything related to population. As I said before, doctors and businesses will benefit from this map. Businesses can use this to help decide where to expand their stores/companies to get the most profit and customers. Doctors could use this to know where would need more hospitals and where there could be less. This information is also useful for other researchers that are studying population growth and decline in the United States. I think that this project took a lot of funding from different sources so they must have had to spend a lot of time gathering investors for finances. I’m not sure if this project would apply to the digital divide, but those people who don’t have internet won’t be able to access this project which is the case for all the other digital geographies that are online. Not everyone is fortunate to have access to the internet so maybe it would be good if in the future digital geographies could be accessed some other way to help accommodate for those who don’t have internet. I don’t think this project would stimulate any resistance as it is a map that only shows predictions of population growth and isn’t about some controversial topic or anything. This is a map that shows useful information about population for anyone who’s interested to look at. It’s a map that required a lot of research and time to make by a group of several people at the Urban Institute. I hope that anyone who looks at this map finds that it was fun to use and learns more about population in the United States. This map was made to help educate people.
